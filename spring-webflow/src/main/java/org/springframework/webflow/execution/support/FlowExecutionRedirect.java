/**
 * Concrete response type that refreshes an application view by redirecting to an <i>existing</i>, active Spring Web
 * Flow execution at a unique SWF-specific <i>flow execution URL</i>. This enables the triggering of post-redirect-get
 * semantics from within an <i>active</i> flow execution.
 * <p>
 * Once the redirect response is issued a new request is initiated by the browser targeted at the flow execution URL.
 * The URL is stabally refreshable (and bookmarkable) while the conversation remains active, safely triggering a
 * {@link ViewState#refresh(org.springframework.webflow.execution.RequestContext)} on each access.
