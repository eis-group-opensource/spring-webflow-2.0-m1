 * Abstract base class for value objects that provide callers into a flow execution information about a logical response
 * to issue and the data necessary to issue it.
 * <p>
 * This class is a generic marker returned when a request into an executing flow has completed processing, indicating a
 * client response needs to be issued. An instance of a ViewSelection subclass represents the selection of a concrete
 * response type. It is expected that callers introspect the returned view selection instance to handle the response
 * types they support.
