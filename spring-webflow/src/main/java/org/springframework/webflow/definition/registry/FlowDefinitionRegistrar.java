/**
 * A strategy to use to populate a flow definition registry with one or more flow definitions.
 * <p>
 * Flow definition registrars encapsulate the knowledge about the source of a set of flow definition resources and the
 * behavior necessary to add those resources to a flow definition registry.
 * <p>
 * The typical usage pattern is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a new (initially empty) flow definition registry.
 * <li>Use any number of flow definition registrars to populate the registry by calling
 * {@link #registerFlowDefinitions(FlowDefinitionRegistry)}.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This design where various registrars populate a generic registry was inspired by Spring's GenericApplicationContext,
 * which can use any number of BeanDefinitionReaders to drive context population.
 *
